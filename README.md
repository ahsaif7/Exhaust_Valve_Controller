# Exhaust_Valve_Controller

This project demonstrates how to control a 12v Exhaust Valve  Motor (DC motor) in both directions with an ESP32 and L298N dual H-bridge motor driver, while simultaneously measuring the motorâ€™s current consumption using an ACS712 20A Hall-effect sensor.

FEATURES:
1)Control - Full bi-directional control of a Exhaust Valve Motor using L298N.
2)Power Supply - Motor and ESP32 powered from an external 12v Battery and Buck Converter.
3)Feedback System - Current sensing with ACS712-20A module connected to ESP32.
4)Calibration - Automatic zero-current calibration at startup.

USE CASE:
To modify the exhaust valve of the car using exhaust valve motor and controller,

This is a Freelance Project no.1
